## Statement coverage

Statement coverage is a white box testing technique, which involves the execution of all the statements at least once in the source code. It is a metric, which is used to calculate and measure the number of statements in the source code which have been executed.

## Branch coverage

Branch coverage is a metric that indicates whether all branches in a codebase are exercised by tests. A "branch" is one of the possible execution paths the code can take after a decision statement—e.g., an if statement—gets evaluated.

## Predicate coverage

Predicate coverage testing is a type of white-box testing that tests all the conditional expressions in a program for all possible outcomes of the conditions. It is also called condition coverage.
